# Hbase-System
● In this project we have explored and implemented the concepts of the
distributed system on Apache Hbase.
● HBase is a distributed column-oriented database built on top of the Hadoop
file system.
● It is an open-source project and is horizontally scalable.
● It's an entirely non- relational database.
● it is a data model that is similar to Google’s big table designed to provide
quick random access to huge amounts of structured data.
